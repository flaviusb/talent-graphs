- Name: Time Out
  Type: OOC
  Description: >
    The safety call for when Out-of-Character
    a player or NPC has been injured or there
    is a substantial safety concern that requires
    the game to stop.
    All players and NPCs are expected where
    possible to go down on one knee where
    appropriate and halt any action except
    where they are assisting with resolving the
    OOC situation.
    The converse call of “Time In” is only to
    be called by the most senior GM (or PC or
    NPC if no GMs are present) and only once
    the one who first made the call is satisfied
    with the resolution.
- Name: Turn [Type]
  Type: Magical
  Default Duration: Until the caller's hand (or the brandished symbol) is lowered.
  Description: In addition to making the call, the caller must either raise their arm parallel to the ground with their open palm facing to the front and perpendicular with the ground, or must brandish an appropriate symbol. All beings of the specified type must retreat from the caller, and cannot target them with any effect.

  Type: Normal
  Description: The target is swifly knocked back a specific distance. If unspecified, the default distance is 5m.
- Name: Knockdown

- Name: Pull [Distance]
  Type: Normal
  Description: The target is swiftly pulled towards the caller up to a specified distance. If unspecified, the default distance is 5m.
- Name: Push
  Type: Normal
  Description: The target is moved to a location pointed at. There must be a clear path to get there. OOC the target must move there with all reasonable swiftness. IC they are being levitated there. They can still be interacted with, restrained, attacked etc on the way there, but they do not count as Incapacitated unless there is some other cause.
- Name: Bestow
  Type: Magical
  Description: The target gains a specified power with specified conditions. The default conditions are one use, until the end of the watch. The power and conditions should be explained OOC if necessary. Special 'Bestowed Power' cards may also be used.
- Name: Polymorph [into...]
  Type: Magical
  Default Duration: Permanent
  Description: The target is transformed into another type of creature. Unless the target has experience with shapeshifting, they are likely to also be Confused or Stunned until they can get used to their new form. Their new form may prevent them from using abilities that they have. An effect that allows for transforming into a creature with new abilities will list if it also Bestows any abilities onto the target. OOC: It is the callers responsibility to provide an adequate physical representation of the target's transformed state. For something human sized, makeup and costume are required. For something significantly smaller or larger, an effigy of what the target has been transformed into may be used, with the target wearing a red headband.
