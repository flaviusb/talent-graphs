- Name: Time Out
  Type: OOC
  Description: >
    The safety call for when Out-of-Character
    a player or NPC has been injured or there
    is a substantial safety concern that requires
    the game to stop.
    All players and NPCs are expected where
    possible to go down on one knee where
    appropriate and halt any action except
    where they are assisting with resolving the
    OOC situation.
    The converse call of “Time In” is only to
    be called by the most senior GM (or PC or
    NPC if no GMs are present) and only once
    the one who first made the call is satisfied
    with the resolution.
